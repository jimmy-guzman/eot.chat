# Visual Identity — Salita.chat

## Reference Collection: Cosmos

The visual identity is derived from 10 reference assets in `docs/reference/cosmos/`.

---

## Core Thesis

**Rooms as private universes.** Every space in the reference set is over-personalised — crammed with objects, art, and life to the point where the room itself becomes a self-portrait. The emotional register is warm, sincere, and slightly impossible: water flooding a floor, an ocean above a glass ceiling, a doorway made of teeth. The uncanny is never frightening — it coexists with the domestic as naturally as a houseplant.

The identity sits at the intersection of **Japanese illustration culture** (kawaii isometric, painterly anime) and **maximalist interior boldness**, filtered through spaces that feel lived-in to the point of overflow.

---

## Medium

**Illustration-first.** Everything should feel drawn, not photographed or rendered. Ink line weight, hand-drawn warmth, and deliberate imprecision are welcome. Flat vectors are acceptable only if they carry visible craft. Avoid frictionless digital polish — the aesthetic is analog warmth, not tech smoothness.

---

## Color

Two registers, used deliberately:

### Soft / Pastel register

Drawn from csms--003, csms--004, csms--008, csms--009: soft pink, mint, warm cream, lavender, chartreuse, powder blue. Intimate, kawaii-adjacent, nostalgic. Use for UI backgrounds, empty states, ambient surfaces.

| Token           | Value     | Source feel                       |
| --------------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| `bg`            | `#FEFAE8` | Warm cream — csms--008 plaster    |
| `soft-pink`     | `#F7C5D0` | Anthurium pink — csms--003, 004   |
| `mint`          | `#B6EDE6` | Teal flood water — csms--003      |
| `chartreuse`    | `#C9EB8A` | Lime accent — csms--009 borders   |
| `powder-blue`   | `#A9D9EC` | Sky / kawaii ceiling — csms--008  |
| `lavender`      | `#D3B8E2` | Purple sofa glow — csms--001      |

### Saturated / Bold register

Drawn from csms--001, csms--002, csms--005, csms--006, csms--010: fire red, cobalt blue, sunflower yellow, orange, ink black. Use for emphasis, interactive states, illustration accents, and graphic moments — never as a background fill.

| Token        | Value     | Source feel                             |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `red`        | `#E8291C` | Red chairs / gallery frames — csms--005 |
| `cobalt`     | `#1A3ABF` | Cobalt wall / poster blue — csms--006   |
| `yellow`     | `#F5E135` | Sunflower chairs, acid poster — csms--006, csms--002 |
| `orange`     | `#F47B1F` | Orange chairs / warm lamp — csms--005, csms--001 |
| `sage`       | `#5A8A6A` | Mural sage — csms--010                  |
| `ink`        | `#1A1A1A` | Line art ink — csms--003, csms--004     |

**Rule:** No desaturated neutrals as a primary choice. Even "neutral" surfaces carry a subtle warm tint. Pure `#FFFFFF` and `#000000` are reserved for line work only.

---

## Typography

**Typeface: M PLUS Rounded 1c** — warm, rounded, slightly handmade. Japanese-designed, works across Latin and Japanese scripts. Reflects the kawaii-adjacent softness of csms--008 and the warm hand-lettered quality of the gallery-wall art in csms--001.

Avoid geometric sans-serifs that read as tech-neutral (Inter, DM Sans, etc.).

| Role              | Weight  | Usage                                      |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Display / heading | 800     | Room names, large labels, splash text      |
| UI / emphasis     | 700     | Buttons, nav, participant names            |
| Body / ambient    | 400     | Message text, descriptions, form labels    |

Loose tracking on display weights. Comfortable line height (1.6–1.7) on body. Never compressed.

## Illustration Language

### Recurring Motifs (from the reference set)

- **Plants** — tropical, lush, overgrown. Monstera, anthuriums, ivy climbing out of frame (csms--003, csms--009)
- **Cats** — small, incidental, never the main subject (csms--004, csms--007)
- **Screens inside screens** — TVs, portals, media as a layer of reality (csms--007, csms--008)
- **Books and shelves** — accumulated objects as ambient texture (csms--007, csms--009)
- **A single human figure** — alone in a large, dense world; introspective, not lonely (csms--003, csms--009)
- **Art on walls** — gallery walls, posters, murals bleeding off frames (csms--001, csms--002, csms--006)

### Surreal Boundary Dissolve

Every illustration should contain one element where physical rules quietly break — matter-of-fact, never dramatic:

- Water flooding a domestic floor without panic (csms--003)
- The ocean existing above a glass ceiling (csms--007)
- A doorway becoming something organic (csms--004)
- The indoor and outdoor merging without acknowledgment (csms--009)

### Density and Detail

Spaces should feel lived-in to the point of overflow. Empty corners are an opportunity. Details reward close looking.

## What to Avoid

- Clean, minimal, tech-neutral aesthetics
- Pure white backgrounds without warmth
- Geometric sans-serifs (Inter, DM Sans, etc.) as the primary type voice
- Flat vector illustration without craft or imperfection
- Empty, airy layouts — density is intentional
- Irony or detachment — the emotional register is sincere
- Cold blue-grays, slate, or anything that reads "SaaS dashboard"
